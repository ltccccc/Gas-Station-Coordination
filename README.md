# Gas-Station-Coordination


Singapore is a country that relies heavily on port transportation and there are many trucks that travel to and from the port. Through observation, we found that gas stations in coastal streets and areas near the port are often congested due to large trucks refueling; due to their large size, the trucks usually occupy two refueling locations while only one fuel gun is actually used. This situation leads to a decrease in the efficiency of gas station operations. We want to train a computer vision-based vehicle type recognition model and establish an efficient and reasonable traffic flow coordination scheme to automatically assign a refueling location to each vehicle coming to the gas station, thus reducing congestion, and improving usage efficiency.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113890277/192419064-3e1b6e13-3d11-416a-9ba9-9af1aaa7d95f.png)
